Questions
=========

Here I keep track of some questions I really wanted to answer during my
studies on CUDA C.

#. If CUDA C manages the distribution to the threads and blocks, what are the
   implications of using different block and thread sizes?::

       ???

#. If the shared memory latency is `\approx 100 \times` lower than uncached
   global memory latency, how to make the access to the array more cache
   friendly?::

       ???
